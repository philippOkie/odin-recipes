            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sour cream, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup buckwheat, rinsed twice with boiling water and drained</li>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Gather the ingredients.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 F. Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove core from cabbage and place in pot. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until softened enough to pull off individual leaves.</p></li>
            <li><p>Carefully remove cabbage head from water and allow it to cool until it's easy to handle. Use a paring knife to cut away thick center stem from each leaf, without cutting all the way through. You will need about 18 stemless leaves.</p></li>
            <li><p>Finely chop remaining cabbage and place it at the bottom of a casserole dish or Dutch oven.</p></li>
            <li><p>Drain potatoes in a sieve or cheesecloth, twisting or pressing to remove as much moisture as possible. </p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer to a large bowl and mix in lemon juice so they don't turn brown. Set aside. </p></li>
            <li><p>In a small skillet, saute chopped onion in butter until tender.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add onion mixture to the potatoes, combining well. </p></li>
            <li><p>Add 1/2 cup of sour cream and rinsed and drained buckwheat to potato mixture, combining thoroughly. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Flip right side of leaf to the middle, then flip left side. You will have something that looks like an envelope. Keep rolling again until you have a neat little roll.</p></li>
            <li><p>Place cabbage rolls on top of chopped cabbage in casserole dish or Dutch oven, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour remaining 1 cup of sour cream over holubtsi, cover, and place in oven. Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the buckwheat filling is tender.</p></li>
        </ol>
